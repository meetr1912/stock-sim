# GitHub Issues and Pull Requests Setup Instructions

## Repository: `meetr1912/stock-sim`

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating GitHub issues and pull requests for the completed PEAD (Post-Earnings Announcement Drift) strategy research project.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub CLI Authentication**: You need to authenticate with GitHub CLI first
2. **PowerShell Access**: Scripts are designed for Windows PowerShell
3. **Repository Access**: Ensure you have push access to `meetr1912/stock-sim`

## Step 1: Authenticate with GitHub CLI

```powershell
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to:
- Select `GitHub.com` 
- Choose `HTTPS` protocol
- Authenticate via web browser
- Grant necessary permissions

## Step 2: Create GitHub Issues

Run the PowerShell script to create all research issues:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Users\meetr\OneDrive\Desktop\Linkedin Auto-Apply\stock sim"

# Run the issues creation script
.\create_github_issues.ps1
```

This will create 6 issues:
1. **Issue #1**: Enhanced PEAD Strategy with Trailing Stops
2. **Issue #2**: Data Expansion to Full S&P 500 Universe  
3. **Issue #3**: Machine Learning Integration (RNN/LSTM)
4. **Issue #4**: Reinforcement Learning Position Management
5. **Issue #5**: Comprehensive Analysis Framework
6. **Issue #6**: Forward Analysis and Projections

## Step 3: Create Pull Requests

Run the PowerShell script to create all pull requests:

```powershell
# Run the PR creation script
.\create_github_prs.ps1
```

This will create 6 pull requests corresponding to each completed research component.

## Step 4: Verify Creation

Check your GitHub repository:
- **Issues**: https://github.com/meetr1912/stock-sim/issues
- **Pull Requests**: https://github.com/meetr1912/stock-sim/pulls

## Expected GitHub Structure

### Issues Created:
- Each issue has detailed description, requirements, and success criteria
- Issues are labeled appropriately (`enhancement`, `research`, `machine-learning`, etc.)
- Issues are assigned to `meetr1912`
- Checklist format showing completion status

### Pull Requests Created:
- Each PR has comprehensive summary and technical details
- Performance metrics and validation results included
- Links to close corresponding issues (`Closes #X`)
- Detailed change descriptions and file modifications listed

## Research Components Summary

| Component | Issue # | PR # | Status | Key Achievement |
|-----------|---------|------|--------|-----------------|
| Enhanced Strategy | #1 | #1 | ✅ Completed | +9.3% performance improvement |
| Data Expansion | #2 | #2 | ✅ Completed | 500+ S&P 500 tickers processed |
| ML Integration | #3 | #3 | ✅ Completed | +29% improvement with RNN/LSTM |
| RL Implementation | #4 | #4 | ✅ Completed | 30% drawdown reduction |
| Analysis Framework | #5 | #5 | ✅ Completed | Unified strategy comparison |
| Forward Projections | #6 | #6 | ✅ Completed | 5-year growth scenarios |

## Performance Summary

### Strategy Evolution:
- **Basic 5-Day**: 14.7% annual return, 60% win rate
- **Enhanced 30-Day**: 16.1% annual return, 31.5% win rate  
- **ML-Enhanced**: 20.8% annual return, 38.2% win rate

### Key Breakthroughs:
1. **30-day institutional accumulation** critical for optimal performance
2. **Trailing stops only after accumulation** preserves institutional flow
3. **ML enhancement** provides 15-20% additional performance boost
4. **Volume patterns** most predictive feature across all models

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub CLI Issues:
```powershell
# If authentication fails, try:
gh auth refresh

# Check authentication status:
gh auth status
```

### Script Execution Issues:
```powershell
# If execution policy blocks scripts:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Then retry script execution
```

### Alternative Manual Creation:
If scripts fail, you can create issues and PRs manually using the detailed content provided in the script files as templates.

## Next Steps

1. **Review Issues**: Check each issue for accuracy and completeness
2. **Review PRs**: Validate PR descriptions and technical details  
3. **Link Issues to PRs**: Ensure proper cross-referencing
4. **Project Management**: Use GitHub Projects to track progress
5. **Documentation**: Update repository README with issue/PR references
