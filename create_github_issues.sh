# Issue #1: Enhanced PEAD Strategy with Trailing Stops
gh issue create \
  --title "Enhanced PEAD Strategy: Implement 30-day holding with trailing stops" \
  --body "## Overview
Modify the basic PEAD strategy to implement:
- 30-day maximum holding period for institutional accumulation
- Trailing stops that only apply AFTER the 30-day period completion
- Enhanced risk management with volume and volatility filters

## Research Context
The Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD) anomaly shows that stocks continue to move in the direction of earnings surprises. Our research indicates that:
- Institutional accumulation typically takes 20-30 days post-earnings
- Applying trailing stops too early interrupts institutional flow
- Optimal performance requires waiting for full accumulation cycle

## Implementation Requirements
- [x] Modify holding period from 5 days to 30 days maximum
- [x] Implement trailing stops only after day 30
- [x] Add volume filtering (>1.8x average) for institutional participation
- [x] Enhanced earnings detection with volatility filters
- [x] Risk management with 2% position sizing

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved total returns (targeting 15-20% improvement)
- Better capture of institutional accumulation patterns
- Reduced premature exits during accumulation phase
- Enhanced risk-adjusted returns through better timing

## Files Modified
- \`enhanced_pead_strategy.py\`
- \`main.py\` (orchestration)
- \`README.md\` (documentation)

## Performance Target
- Win rate: 35-40% (quality over quantity)
- Average return per trade: >2%
- Annual return: 18-25%
- Sharpe ratio: >0.3" \
