TRAILING STOP ANALYSIS:
- 57.5% of positions were stopped out early
- Average holding period reduced from 30 to 15.2 days
- This provided downside protection while improving risk-adjusted returns

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The 30-day holding period captures more institutional flow
2. Trailing stops effectively limit downside risk
3. Focus on trades with high institutional activity scores
4. Consider tightening stops during volatile market periods

NOTES:
- Analysis uses price gaps as proxy for earnings surprises
- Institutional score based on volume patterns and price trends
- For production: integrate actual earnings data and real-time stops
